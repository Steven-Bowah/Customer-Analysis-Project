# Customer-Analysis-Project
 Welcome to the Customer Analysis Project repository! In this project, we delve into a comprehensive analysis of customer behavior based on various demographic and lifestyle factors. The primary focus is to understand the key determinants influencing customers' decisions to purchase bikes. Leveraging advanced Microsoft Excel features, including pivot tables, data validation, and a variety of advanced formulas, we explore relationships between key variables such as income, gender, commuting distance, age, and the ultimate decision to purchase bikes.
Dataset: The dataset used for this analysis encompasses a diverse set of customer information, including Marital status, Gender, Income, Number of children, Education status, Occupation, Home Ownership, Number of cars, Commute distance, Region, Age, Number of bikes, purchased, Key Analyses.
Key Analyses;
1. Income vs. Gender; A central aspect of the analysis involves examining the relationship between customers' income levels and their gender. By utilizing tools like VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, and array formulas, we aim to uncover insights into income distribution across different gender categories.
2. Commuting Distance and Bike Purchases; We explore the impact of commuting distance on customers' decisions to purchase bikes. Employing advanced formulas and data validation techniques, the project aims to identify patterns and correlations between commuting distance and bike purchasing behavior.
3. Age and Bike Purchases; Age is a crucial factor in understanding customer preferences. Through the application of INDEX-MATCH and nested IF statements, we investigate how age influences the likelihood of customers purchasing bikes.
