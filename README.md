# Customer-Analysis-Project
 Welcome to the Customer Analysis Project repository! In this project, we delve into a comprehensive analysis of customer behavior based on various demographic and lifestyle factors. The primary focus is to understand the key determinants influencing customers' decisions to purchase bikes. Leveraging advanced Microsoft Excel features, including pivot tables, data validation, and a variety of advanced formulas, we explore relationships between key variables such as income, gender, commuting distance, age, and the ultimate decision to purchase bikes.
